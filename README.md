# Cody's Nintendo Network

Welcome to **Cody's Nintendo Network**, the digital sandbox for one chaotic developer who likes to blend Nintendo, APIs, Discord bots, and mild internet gremlin energy.

This site is hosted using GitHub Pages and includes:
- âœ… Custom Discord bot projects
- âœ… API endpoints made for fun (and sometimes usefulness)
- âœ… Nintendo Switch-related utilities
- âœ… Experimental pages, random tools, and chaos
